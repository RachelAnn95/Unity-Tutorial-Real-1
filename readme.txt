Unity Tutorial 1 readme file

I completed the tutorial, build it correctly, and saved it as an executable named "miniGame."

For my "something unique" I got inspiration from our Amaze-ing Assignment. I created a simple maze with walls and had pick up cubes scattered around the maze. The playe starts in at the top of the ground and has to collect all 15 cubes throughout the maze to win.
